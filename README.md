# p2p car-sharing

MOTIVATION:

1. The motivation for adopting a peer-to-peer car-sharing system over traditional car ownership lies in its cost efficiency, optimized resource usage, reduced environmental impact, flexibility, convenience, community-building, and integration of technology. 
2. The Traditional car-sharing process involves manual intervention and lacks transparency, leading to delays, disputes, and inefficiencies.
3. Users participating in traditional car-sharing platforms often have limited control over their personal data and ownership rights, as these are managed by centralized entities. This lack of user empowerment hinders transparency and user trust in the ecosystem, necessitating a solution that grants users greater authority and ownership over their data and rights. 
4. This ‘Peer to Peer Car sharing’ addresses the drawbacks of traditional car ownership by offering a more economical, sustainable, and adaptable solution that resonates with modern preferences.
